# Quantum Algorithms and subroutines

Following are few quantum algorithms as well as the qiskit implementation
The following packages and imports will be used for all the following programs

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector
from qiskit.visualization import plot_state_qsphere
import numpy as np
from qiskit import IBMQ, BasicAer
from qiskit.providers.ibmq import least_busy
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit,  execute
from qiskit.tools.jupyter import *
provider=IBMQ.load_account()
```


## Quantum Teleportation

### Overview
Alice wants to send quantum information to Bob. Specifically, suppose she wants to send the qubit state  . This entails passing on information about  and  to Bob.

There exists a theorem in quantum mechanics which states that you cannot simply make an exact copy of an unknown quantum state \pi. This is known as the no-cloning theorem. As a result of this we can see that Alice can't simply generate a copy of  and give the copy to Bob. We can only copy classical states (not superpositions).

However, by taking advantage of two classical bits and an entangled qubit pair, Alice can transfer her state  to Bob. We call this teleportation because, at the end, Bob will have  and Alice won't anymore.


## Usage

```python
from qiskit import *
circuit=QuantumCircuit(3,3)


circuit.x(0)
circuit.barrier()

circuit.h(1)
circuit.cx(1,2)

circuit.cx(0,1)
circuit.h(0)

circuit.measure([0,1],[0,1])

circuit.cz(0,2)
circuit.cx(1,2)

circuit.measure(2,2)
circuit.draw()

```
